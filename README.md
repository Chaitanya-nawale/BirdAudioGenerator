Chasing Birds Project:
• Multi‑Modal Diffusion Model for Joint Text, Image and Audio Generation
• Aim of the project was to generate bird audio based on the input bird image or label
• Combined Xeno‑canto audio and iNaturalist bird image datasets in the data preparation stage
• Developed a solution by training AudioCLIP on bird data (text, image and audio) to generate embeddings and then feeding it to the trained
AudioLDM (Diffusion based audio generation model) in order to generate respective bird audios.
