## Potential datasets

1. [AutoReCap](https://snap-research.github.io/GenAU/dataset.html)<br> This is a huge audio-text-video dataset for ambient audio. They do some text to audio generation. We can do image to audio synthesis based on this dataset.

2. [SoundNet](https://soundnet.csail.mit.edu/)<br>
Another image to sound dataset for ambient sounds like river, beach, vegetation etc.

3. [Environmental Audio sounds](https://homepages.tuni.fi/toni.heittola/datasets)<br>
No accompanying video but there's a large collection of labelled audio.


4. [Sounding Earth Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/5600379)<br>
Aerial images accompanied with high quality audio. Not sure what each sample sounds like but worth exploring.

5. [iNaturalistSound dataset](https://github.com/visipedia/inat_sounds/tree/main/2024)<br>
This is a comprehensive dataset of different species of animals and the sounds they make. This may lead to some creative ideas but may require us to pivot again.
