## ðŸ“… Weekly Contribution Details

### Week 1 (30-04 to 07-05)
Had to find my bearing after joining the group slightly later on.

1. Reseached audio to visual models for the StableLoFiEditor idea
2. Looked into other datasets 
3. Got some older web scraper I built to work for Youtube videos

Learned a bit about audio to video models and how to infer intermediate frames to generate a video from single frames. However, idea was ultimately scrapped.
I looked into further datasets and settled on the possibility of simply scraping further Youtube videos. I got an old webscraper I built for my Bachelor's to work on scraping Youtube videos.

### Week 2 (07-05 to 14-05)
Did not have much time this week due to visit at my parents'. Looked into computing the latents in MMAudio, but we pivoted to another topic before getting anywhere with that.

### Week 3 (14-05 to 21-05)

1. Ran initial inference on MMAudio using the iNaturalist dataset. 
2. Checked whether image data is useable if converted to static video of a single image. It is.
3. Created presentation template.

I was ready to stay with MMAudio, but ultimately got swayed by the much smaller computation time of AudioLDM.

1. Looked into a way to replace the text embedding in the model with an image embedding.
